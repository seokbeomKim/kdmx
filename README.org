* KDMX for Mac OS

This is a simple program included in agent-proxy
(git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/kernel/kgdb/agent-proxy.git). I've just
changed *a* line to make the program available in Mac OS since there is no ioctl
in BSD.


* What is KDMX?

kdmx is a program designed to split GDB packets and other trafic coming
from a target on a serial line into 2 separate pseudo-ttys.

The most common use of this is to run kgdb and console on a single serial
port, but should be usable for alternating gdbserver or console over a serial
line as well.

To exit from kdmx, kill the program or issue a control-c.

Full usage information can be obtained from:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
   make
   ./kdmx -h
#+END_SRC
